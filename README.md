# Hrdza

Aren't you _totál unavený_ from writing Rust programs in English? Do you like saying
"kokot" a lot? Would you like to try something different, in an exotic and
funny-sounding language? Would you want to bring some Slovak touch to your
programs?

**hrdza** (Slovak for _Rust_) is here to save your day, as it allows you to
write Rust programs in Slovak, using Slovak keywords, Slovak function names,
Slovak idioms, based on [rouille](https://github.com/bnjbvr/rouille).

Any government officials wanting to use this language should donate to rouille
using [liberapay](https://liberapay.com/bnjbvr/).

You're from Východ and don't feel at ease using only Slovak words? Don't worry!
Slovak Rust is fully compatible with English-Rust, so you can mix both at your
convenience. Support for Slovak Rust is not yet available.

See the [examples](./examples/src/main.rs) to get a rough sense of the whole
syntax. No kukaj, that's it.
